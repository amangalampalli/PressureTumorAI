# Pressure-Based-Tumor-Detection

This project consists of various internal files that pertain to different tasks.

This whole project is designed to create a system that can use Statistics and Machine Leanring to produce a prediction of where tumors may be depending on pressure values.

The whole project is written in Python with some of the various microcontroller files written in C. This whole project is currently at a standstill since more testing on human patients is required before continuing.
